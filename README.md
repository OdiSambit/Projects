Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Completed a series of end-to-end Machine Learning and Data Science projects demonstrating strong skills in Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Developed a CNN-based Brain Tumour MRI Classification model with 87% accuracy and a tumour recall of 0.99, showcasing expertise in image preprocessing, augmentation, model tuning, and healthcare-focused deep learning. Built a Health Insurance Cost Prediction model using multiple linear regression, achieving an R² of 0.80 through detailed EDA, correlation analysis, feature engineering, and performance evaluation. Designed a COVID-19 Data Visualization system featuring trend analysis, comparative charts, and heatmaps to identify patterns in global case distribution. These projects collectively demonstrate proficiency in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, deep learning, model evaluation, and visual storytelling—reflecting a strong foundation in applying ML techniques to real-world datasets.
